Yes. It's me again. Hi. This time with some DOS stuff.
Well, I started this two little, nice and useful (I guess) programs
because I had the right computer with the right compiler in the right
boring class ;).
Ok, Read Boot reads the boot sector (sector 0) from the first floppy
drive (A) and writes it to a file. You may pass the filename as the
first argument. If no filename is given, it will be called "BOOT.SCT".

For example:
C:\>rboot                  will download the boot sector to the file boot.sct
C:\>rboot file.ext         will download the boot sector to the file file.ext

And Write Boot makes the exact opposite. Reads 512 bytes from a file and
then overwrites the boot sector.

For example:
C:\>wboot                  will read the file boot.sct
C:\>wboot file.ext         will read the file file.ext

Is this useful?

Well, that depends. First of all, I did this programs with an educational
intention.  No, don't laugh. It's true ;)
But let's face it....I did collect viruses during the DOS era. And with
this program you may continue your collection by just "grabbing" the
boot sector virus from the floppy and putting it in a file.
And how about "grabbing" a known-clean boot sector and disinfect
any floppy from ANY boot sector virus in a few seconds?
I included some images for your own experiment.

Notes:
-----
This program is under the GNU/GPL version 2 license.
Both programs do compile with A86. But you should have no problems with
other compilers.
I (Marcelo Gornstein) don't take any responsability from the consequences
derived from your use of these two programs. Legal stuff, you know. Had
to be there ;)

Send me your comments, suggestions, etc.

Regards,
